We switched our dataset from mushroom data to maternal health. We updated the assignment on Google CLassroom and he name of the files. We were unable to rename our team on Github.

We swtiched because we weren't sure how to convert the words and question marks into numbers, and thought the maternal health data seemed a lot more interesting. For the first few thousand iterations, we had a low rate of error: around 0.0004. However, after 5,000 iterations, we started getting much higher error values. We got values such as 8.31522e-05, which when put into a calculator as written was an error value of 17; turning the -05 into an exponent gave an error value of 0.05 which, while below 1, was still higher than what we had.
